For my water pump project, I worked in a group of 5 other people: Ben Ehemann, Victor Lançon, Casey Savage, Akshay Undevia, and Jeff (Puxuan) Yang. We opted to create a water pump with a boxer pump design; we had four pistons, two in tandem on each side of the pump. We opted for this design to maximize water output, as the more pistons we had, the more water we would theoretically be able to pump out.

We began the design phase in late February/early March and finished manufacturing in early April. In early May, we were able to begin testing our water pump with the given setup. 

Our main issues with our initial design was machinability. Our initial design featured two fork-like shafts that would require 90 degree welds. This couldn’t be achieved with our skill set, so we had to pivot our design rather quickly. We opted to make most of our shafts and housing out of acrylic, because the material tests we conducted deemed the material to be strong enough for the forces that would be acting on the pump.

Our initial tests with the final testing set up proved that our pump was working correctly and parts didn't seize up inside the cylinders. However, when we hooked up water to our inlet and outlet heads, our initial tests proved to be drastically wrong. Within seconds, we had pumped 0.5 L but our housing completely cracked. We quickly fixed this by stabilizing and reinforcing the cracked area with super glue and clamping the weakest parts of our housing with C-clamps. We also reinforced the middle part of pump so try a flat piece of wood, so we could apply downward pressure on the tops of our cylinder. Our quick fix proved to work as we pumped a total of 5.7 L with only 2 of our pistons working. However, when we tried with all four of pistons, our housing cracked again, rendering our pump completely unusable. 

If we were to attempt this project again, we would do everything the exact same and make our housing out of stronger materials (like wood or metal). I think we could pump 9L of water (or even more) if we were to make this fix.

This project was a ton of fun and I learned a lot about how pumps work. I felt like a true engineer after tackling this project!
